## Description
The goal with this project was to create a reactive and updated crypto currency website where you are able to search a given currency and you should recieve feedback pertaining to the searched currency with price and the change the coin has undergone in the past 24 hours, you also get 2 gifs that correspond to the change whether it be negative or positive.
The only tools available were past lectures and resources we learned in class, We also used help from student alumni. The API documentation was a good resource aswell!
The reason for making this project was to challenge what We can do with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the web APIs as tools for success. 
We learned the good and hard side of working as a group being the first group project... Starting slow with little knowhow on what to split the project up into. Then with guide from the project manager(TA), we excelled with our work proficiency and using the workflow tools to help guide a path to the MVP of the project. Future development is exciting to think about and having the newfound ability to work as a group feels great!

## Credits
